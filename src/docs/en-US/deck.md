# Deck

Deck is one of the available UI types.By displaying several views called "Columns" next to another, it provides high customizability and can display high amounts of information at once.

## Adding columns
You can add additional columns by right-clicking the Deck background and pressing "Add column".

## Moving columns
You can switch the positions of two columns via drag-and-dropping them or change a column's position from its column menu (accesible by right-clicking the column header).

## Horizontally dividing columns
Columns can not only be arranged vertically, but also horizontally. If you click "Stack on left column" when opening the column menu, the column will be moved below the column to the left of the current one. To cancel the stacking, press the "Pop to the right" button in the column menu.

## Column settings
You can edit individual column settings by clicking "Edit" in the column menu.You can edit a column's name and width.

## Deck settings
Deck-related settings can be found in [settings/deck](/settings/deck).
