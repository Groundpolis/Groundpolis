# Custom Emoji
Custom emojis are a function that allows images uploaded to the server to be used like emojis. They can be used in notes, reactions, chat, your profile, your username as well as other places. To use custom emojis in the above mentioned places, press the Emoji picker button (if present) or type a `:` and emoji suggestions will appear. If a string that looks like `:foo:` is found in any text, then the `foo` portion is interpreted as a custom emoji name and will be replaced with said custom emoji picture when displayed.
