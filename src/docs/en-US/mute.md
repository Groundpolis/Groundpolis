# Mute

If you mute a user, the following contents related to that user will not be displayed by Misskey anymore:

* Posts of that user on the timeline or in the search results (including Renotes or replies to related to these posts)
* Notifications from that user
* Chat history with that user in the chat history list

To mute a user, press the "Mute" button displayed on the user's profile page.

Users muted by you will not be notified that they have been muted, and will also not know that they have been muted by you.

You can confirm the list of users you have muted in the settings by going to Settings > Mute / Block
